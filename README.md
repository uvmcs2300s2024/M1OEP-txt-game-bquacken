Ben Quackenbush Open Ended Project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello welcome to my Open ended project. 
It is a small text based game that currently has one area(field) and one 
sub-area(fortress) you play the game by selecting an option through the option 
menu displayed it has full input validation.
The concepts used from this module are c++ classes overloaded operators and 
enumeration. you can see c ++ classes where I have created .h and .cpp files 
for each of my objects this includes the inventory, items, field, and 
player all working together and I use input to do all the input validation.
The enumerated types are used for locations and items each creating a specific 
data type for playerLocations, discoveredLocations, and itemType. I used 
overloaded operators for comparing items and for printing out item and 
inventory objects in a readable format this was very important as there 
is a lot of printing out item objects and the inventory object.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project can easily be expanded on an example of this is either adding new 
areas and instead of using a function to make the subarea I could use 
subclasses. I could add visual elements with a map or a mor polished interface.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that I should earn 95 points for this project.

Main Program complexity and usability - 40 pts: I used a mix of module 1 
concepts with multiple classes interacting to create a small game demo

Concept: c++ class - 20 pts: all of my classes were split into .h and .cpp
files with thorough documentation in the header files and complex and useful
code in the .cpp files. With all the classes coming together to make a 
very organized main class that is easy to read.

extra 35 - I feel that I went beyond project requirements in the scope and 
complexity of the code because this game can be easily expanded because I fully
made some of the classes instead of making a scripted game so that the game
can be expanded.
