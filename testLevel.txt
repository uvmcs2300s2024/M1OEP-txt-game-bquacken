You drop into a small hole in the ground landing in a small puddle of water.
The only light visible is coming from the hole. You see the scraps left of an
old campsite. To your left is a rancid smelling cave, in front of you there is
a wooden wall blocking a cave entrance and in the floor is a sloping cave that
goes down until you can't see anymore.

as you walk farther the smell becomes unbearable until
you reach a small chamber coated with a glistening material.
At the far end of the chamber you see a corpse
wedged into a small crack in the wall. As you get
closer to the source of the smell you notice the tendrils converge
on this rotten corpse you search inside its putrid smelling clothes.
